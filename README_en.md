## Project Purpose

This project is developed by Shenzhen Xiaolu Yanling Technology Co., Ltd. It is an AI-based homework tutoring product built on the open-source chatbot ‚ÄúXiaoZhi,‚Äù aimed at exploring its commercial applications in educational scenarios.

We hope this product can help parents of primary school students‚Äîespecially those lacking time, energy, or subject expertise‚Äîassist their children more easily with homework. With vivid and interactive AI explanations, children can better understand and reinforce classroom knowledge.

Leveraging the rapid development of large language models, we are bringing advanced AI technology to affordable smart hardware. This allows children in underserved markets and small-town families to access cutting-edge technology without barriers, contributing to a fairer educational landscape.

We welcome developers and users to join us in building and improving this project. If you have any suggestions or ideas, feel free to contact us and collaborate with us to refine the product.
